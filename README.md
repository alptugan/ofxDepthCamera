# ofxDepthCamera

Device-independent library for working with depth cameras, recording, playback, and streaming remotely

**This is a work in progress!** It's half-done (at best), so some stuff isn't implemented yes and the rest probably doesn't work :) Send a note if you're curious what this is about or want to help. More info coming soon.

## Motivation


## Setup

Clone my version of these addons which are templated to work with various types of ofPixels:

- [ofxImageSequence](https://github.com/mattfelsen/ofxImageSequence/tree/templated)
- [ofxImageSequencePlayback](https://github.com/mattfelsen/ofxImageSequence/tree/templated)
- [ofxImageSequenceRecorder](https://github.com/mattfelsen/ofxImageSequence/tree/templated)

```
git clone https://github.com/mattfelsen/ofxImageSequence --branch templated
git clone https://github.com/mattfelsen/ofxImageSequencePlayback --branch templated
git clone https://github.com/mattfelsen/ofxImageSequenceRecorder --branch templated
```
